# This function holds the equation for updating the parameters
# of the logistic regression model. X_train and Y_train are
# a necessary part of the update formula, W is needed for updating
# to take place, and eta is the learning rate parameter for
# gradient ascent/descent optimization.

function [W] = gAscent(X_train, Y_train, W, eta)
  
   [N, D] = logRegOutput(X_train, W);
   prob = N./D;
   
   W(1:end-1, :) = W(1:end-1, :) + eta*((cat2bin(Y_train) - prob)'*X_train)(1:end-1, :);
