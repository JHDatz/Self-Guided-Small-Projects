# k-Means-and-EM-Clustering

(Work in Progress)

This respository is a small example of how the k-means clustering and EM algorithm work in Octave. Synthetic data from a basic Gaussian Mixture model is generated, and then these two algorithms learn to produce a distribution from the sample data.

These algorithms are adapted from Chapter 9 of Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning, by Christopher Bishop.
